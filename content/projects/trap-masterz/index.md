##### IMM 406 Prototyping For Advanced Systems  
##### Fall 2024  
##### Final Prototype  

In this multiplayer prototype, one person plays as the "Trap Master" who works to catch the runner,  but there's a twist - they can't see where the runner is going!  Use auditory and other visual clues to try and figure out when the time is right to strike.  Activate your traps too early, and the other Trap Masters will hear about it!
