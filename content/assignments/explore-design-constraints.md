title: Explore Design Constraints Prototype
order: 6
---

In class, we will explore the technology and collaboratively create a list of various design constraints. Choose one, from this list or not.

This is a one-week, individual assignment.

Each student will choose a design constraint, and then create a single demonstrative/explorative sketch that fulfills the following goals:

1. Gives the creator of the sketch insight into the chosen design space.
2. Effectively communicates the space to others.
3. Provides insight for making a design decision about this space.

For example, if we were looking at fine repetitive textures, perhaps there is a room full of objects of varying textures and texture resolutions that look better/worse, laid out along a spectrum.
There is clear A/B comparison. Further, one would be able to understand how they might choose certain texture densities going forward.

 > See the rubric with the assignment on brightspace for further clarification of project expectations.

*Remember, this is about design decisions. When working with technology where "better technology" would help, that's not the answer. The technology is **as provided**, we are determining what we can do with that.*

### Some Possible Constraints
Mobile AR:
- How much of the world to cover with overlays
- How quickly can we ask/get the user to move
- How far away can we display content
- What size can we make something look (What is too large, what is too small)
- How far "into" or "behind" real things can we display virtual things (e.g. holes, wells, etc)
- *Pick an input method, identify it's strength and/or weakness. That's a design constraint/space to test*


Novel Human-Computer Interactions
1. Decide on a sensor and on an interaction with that sensor.
