title: Research Question Prototype
order: 2
---

This project revisits the sketches, except the purpose is exploration of the hardware.

While sketches are explorations of ideas, this project refines that into an exploration of capabilities.

Create 1-3 sketches for the system, with a unique goal. Have a single hardware/technical question in your mind, and explore it until you are satisfied you will be able to present some insight.

Title the project with the constraint/question you are exploring, and take screenshots or video capture.

## Example Questions (Lightship)
- How does Meshing Work for Physics?
- How can we use nav meshes? What are they?
- What type of content can we put in an AR space?
- What kinds of objects can we use Object Detection for? Can we detect things in motion? Images on screens? Pets?
- How closely aligned are shared AR spaces?
- What is the smallest image we can use for tracking based localization?
- How can I get two phones to acknowledge each other?
- What are the near and far limits of occlusion? How large and small of an object can I put in a scene, using occlusion effectively?
- What limits are there to the depth texture being sampled and used in for other systems, like the visual effect graph?
- How accurate is the WPS system? How low latency? How often does the WPS lat/long data update?

## Example Questions (Tilt5)
-	How does MixCast work? What are its limitations?
-	Does Video playback work in the tilt five?
-	How hard is it to track multiple wands?
-	Can we use multiple wands with one headset? More than two?
-   Can we align the tilt five with other tracking technology, like vive?
-	Can we show unique views or secret information to different headsets?
-	How small can we effectively render?
-	How far away can we make the player feel?
-   What sort of other real-world items could we put on the tilt five mat?
-	How close can we put the players face? How can we encourage head movement?
-	What sorts of environments look good here?
-	Also see: perception!
