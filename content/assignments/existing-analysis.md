title: Existing Project Analysis
order: 3
---

Find and experience a hardware-related or approved AR experience.

You should spend more than 15 dedicated minutes just exploring the *thing*. 

Take detailed notes on design and execution decisions you notice while playing. Take notes on what you react to, what works well, what isn't working, etc. 

During class before this assignment, we will have created a survey of questions to ask about existing projects. Your assignment is two parts:

1. Fill out the survey we created about this experience.
2. Capture and submit your notes. They can be informal.
